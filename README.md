# Spring Boot 3.1 @ServiceConnection demo

This repository shows multiple ways how to set up and use Testcontainers in a Spring Boot application, including the new `@ServiceConnection` annotation.

Note that Postgres container is used just as an example and in case you're looking to integrate Spring Boot with a relational database container you may want to check Testcontainers' built-in JDBC support: https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/databases/jdbc/
